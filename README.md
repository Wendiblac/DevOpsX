# DevOpsX: Cloud Infrastructure Deployment & Automation üöÄ
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

Welcome to DevOpsX ‚Äî a comprehensive DevOps project that showcases my ability to deploy, configure, and automate a production-ready cloud infrastructure from scratch.

This hands-on project was part of my second semester exam challenge, where I provisioned and secured an AWS EC2 Linux server, linked a custom subdomain, configured Nginx with SSL, and built a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Ansible and GitHub Actions.
The goal was to simulate a real-world, investor-ready deployment environment ‚Äî and I delivered it live at:

üîó https://devops.wendiblac.com

## üîß Project Overview

- **Platform:** AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) VPC
- **Automation Tools:** Ansible, GitHub Actions
- **Server:** Nginx
- **CI/CD:** Automatic deployment on `git push`
- **Domain/Subdomain:** `devops.wendiblac.com` (linked via DNS)
- **SSL/TLS:** Enabled with Let's Encrypt & Certbot


## üöÄ Step 1 ‚Äì EC2 Server Setup on AWS

To begin, I provisioned an EC2 instance from my AWS console. I named the instance `DevOpsX-Server` to match the project branding.

I selected **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS** for the AMI because it‚Äôs stable, widely supported, and ideal for provisioning with tools like Ansible. Plus, it‚Äôs free-tier eligible, which was important for keeping this deployment cost-effective.

For the instance type, I went with **t2.micro**‚Äîalso free-tier eligible and sufficient for this type of test deployment.

I selected my existing key pair for SSH access.

I chose my preconfigured network setup: a **custom VPC** I had already created, with a public subnet.

I also used a **security group** I had tailored beforehand to allow HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH traffic safely.

The complete Network Setup.

After launching the instance, I grabbed the **public IPv4 address**, which I would later use to connect the subdomain. 
I SSH‚Äôd into the instance using my WSL terminal on Windows ‚Äî one of the fastest ways for me to interact with Linux environments directly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2 ‚Äì Installing and Preparing Ansible Locally

Next, I installed **Ansible** on my local WSL Ubuntu environment. I started by running:
sudo apt update
![System Update](./screenshots/sys-update.png)

sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
![Software Properties Installation](./screenshots/software-install.png)

sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
![Ansible Dependency](./screenshots/ppa-ansible.png)

sudo apt install ansible -y
![Ansible Installation](./screenshots/ansible.png)

ansible --version
![Ansible Version](./screenshots/ansible-v.png)

Once Ansible was installed, I created a directory to keep the private key to ssh into the instance and the inventory.ini.
![Key Directory](./screenshots/key-dir.png)

I proceeded to add the ssh code line in the inventory.ini file to ssh into the EC2 host securely with the key copied from my local directory.
![Inventory file](./screenshots/inventory.png)

I then copied my private SSH key into WSL, ensuring I gave it the correct file permissions so Ansible could use it securely.
![SSH Private Key](./screenshots/key.png)

To test that everything was working, I ran the following command:
**ansible -i inventory.ini web -m ping**
It returned a successful ping from the EC2 instance, which confirmed that I could now use Ansible to automate configurations remotely.
![Ansible Ping](./screenshots/ansible-ping.png)

## üìÅ Step 3 ‚Äì Structuring My Project & Writing the Playbook

With the connection set up, I proceeded to set up a playbook **site.yml** and configured it to install and ensure nginx is running. 
![Nginx Playbook Configuration](./screenshots/playbook-nginx.png)

I ran the playbook to proceed with the installation using:
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini site.yml
![Nginx Installation](./screenshots/nginx.png)

Once it completed, I tested the public IP of the EC2 instance in the browser and saw the default Nginx landing page. That confirmed that my Ansible configuration and server setup were working properly.
![WebServer Running](./screenshots/webserver.png)

## üåç Step 4 ‚Äì Linking Subdomain and Adding SSL

With the server up, I moved on to connect my subdomain. I already had a main domain hosted on Netlify, so I went into my DNS settings there and created an A record for the subdomain **devops.wendiblac.com** pointing to the EC2‚Äôs public IP.
![DNS Record Setup](./screenshots/dns.png)

I verified it was propagating correctly by running ping devops.wendiblac.com, which successfully resolved to my EC2 server.
![Domain Confirmation](./screenshots/devops-ping.png)

Now that the subdomain worked, I deleted the default Nginx file and created a test file 'Hello from DevOpsX', I proceeded to install Certbot with Nginx support for HTTPS:
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
sudo certbot --nginx -d devops.wendiblac.com
![Certbot Installation](./screenshots/certbot-inst.png)

This command automatically updated my Nginx configuration and generated a valid SSL certificate from Let‚Äôs Encrypt. 
![Certificate Generated](./screenshots/cert.png)

After that, I visited the site and confirmed that the HTTPS lock was showing and the certificate was active.
![Certificate Confirmation](./screenshots/test-site.png)

To prep the site for deployment, I deleted my test files, using sudo rm index.html
![Test File Deletion](./screenshots/rm-testfile.png) 

Before I proceeded to clone my website repo, I ensured Git was installed and updated, by running; sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y.
![Git Installation](./screenshots/git-inst.png) 

I then proceeded to clone my project repository from GitHub directly onto the server for the deployment, by running ; sudo git clone https://github.com/Wendiblac/DevOpsX.git .
![Website File Clone](./screenshots/repo.png)
_used a period at the end to ensure it is cloned into the current directory_

I updated file permissions for web accessibility with chown and chmod then I reloaded the server.
![Repository Permissions](./screenshots/repo-perm.png)

To complete the deployment I then organized and moved my website files into the correct Nginx directory for easy accesibility.
![Website Files](./screenshots/site-files.png)
 
Once I refreshed the browser, my full custom landing page loaded under https://devops.wendiblac.com secured and hosted live successfullyüöÄ.

## üîÅ Bonus Step ‚Äì CI/CD with GitHub Actions + Ansible
I took an extra step to make the deployment process more realistic, I implemented a basic CI/CD pipeline.
I went into my GitHub repo and added the following secrets:
‚Ä¢	SSH_USER ‚Äì the EC2 username (ubuntu)
‚Ä¢	SSH_HOST ‚Äì the public IP or domain
‚Ä¢	SSH_KEY ‚Äì my private key (base64-encoded)
![Action Secrets](./screenshots/secrets.png)

Then I created a GitHub Actions workflow file at .github/workflows/deploy.yml. This workflow runs on every push to the main branch and does the following:
‚Ä¢	Connects to the EC2 instance using SSH
‚Ä¢	Executes my Ansible playbook to redeploy the updated project files
‚Ä¢	Restarts Nginx if necessary
This way, every time I update my code and push to GitHub, the server automatically syncs and reflects the changes live.
![Github Workflows](./screenshots/deploy-yml.png)


I then created a provisioning directory, Inside the provisioning/ folder, I wrote a playbook (ansible.yml) to install and configure Nginx on the EC2 server. I ensured Nginx would start automatically, and added tasks to handle syncing the actual website files into /var/www/devops-test.
![Ansible Deploy](./screenshots/ansible-yml.png)

After pushing the changes, the Github Actions Workflow and Provisions, I checked the GitHub Actions for Deployment Success üöÄ.

‚úÖ Final Outcome üçæ
After all the steps, I had a live, secure website hosted at https://devops.wendiblac.com, deployed on AWS EC2, automated with Ansible, and continuously delivered via GitHub Actions.
This project was a deep, practical dive into the responsibilities of a DevOps/Cloud Engineer. I touched every layer: infrastructure provisioning, server automation, DNS setup, HTTPS, web server config, GitHub integration, and CI/CD.
I learned how to troubleshoot each step, and more importantly, how to think through each decision like an engineer focused on security, efficiency, and scalability.
